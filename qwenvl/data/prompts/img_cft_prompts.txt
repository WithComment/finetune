Consider the clinical application of the findings in this image. Based on what you see, describe the most likely next step in patient management or diagnosis.,
Perform an in-depth exploration of this image. Go beyond the primary finding and describe the subtle visual details and nuanced characteristics of the anatomy and any pathologies present.,
Reflect on the diagnostic information presented in this image. Describe the level of certainty for the primary finding. What alternative diagnoses (differentials) could also be considered, even if less likely, based on the visual evidence?,
Engage creatively with this image. Beyond its immediate diagnostic purpose, what makes this a particularly good or interesting example for teaching, research, or developing new imaging techniques? Highlight its unique visual qualities.,
Synthesize all the visual information in this image into a single, concise concluding statement or 'impression'. This summary should encapsulate the most critical findings and their overall significance.,
Focus on the key concepts presented visually. Identify and describe only the essential, 'hallmark' features in this image that define the primary diagnosis. Disregard incidental or non-contributory findings.,
Place this image in a broader anatomical and clinical context. Describe how the findings you see relate to the three-dimensional structure of the organ and the typical progression of the suspected condition.,
Critically analyze this image not just for its content, but for its quality. Evaluate potential artifacts, limitations, or technical factors (e.g., motion, noise, poor contrast) that could impact diagnostic interpretation. State whether the image quality is adequate for a confident diagnosis.,
Answer the following questions based on the image: 1. What is the primary finding? 2. Where is it located? 3. What are its key visual characteristics? 4. What is the most likely diagnosis? 5. Are there any important secondary findings?,
Perform a comparative analysis. How are the visual features in this image typical for the primary diagnosis? In what ways do they differ from the classic presentation of a key differential diagnosis?
